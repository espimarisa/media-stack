My homelab setup and configs.

## Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your environment variables. Be sure to review `docker-compose.yml` for any options you need to change.

## Updating

Run `scripts/update.sh`. If you have any local changes to `docker-compose.yml`, they will be overwritten. It's recommended to fork this repository to keep your base config up to date more easily if you wish to use this script.
